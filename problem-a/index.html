 <!-- Your task is to create a simple web page that describes a fictional character
 that you admire. This can be any character from a movie, television series, book,
 comic, song, or story. The page will include the character's name, a short
 description of the character, a picture, some reasons you admire that character,
 and a link to another web page that provides more information about the character
 or the story. -->
