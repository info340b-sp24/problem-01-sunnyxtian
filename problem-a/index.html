    <p>
      Bojji is a character from the anime
      <cite><a href="https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/ranking-of-kings">Ranking of Kings</a></cite>.
      He is a teenage boy who has an abnormally small body.
      He became the King of Bosse Kingdom after his dad, a respected king, died,
      but no one takes him seriously because he's so small.

      <h2>3 reasons why I love Bojji</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>He's a humble King. He doesn't think of himself as any better than other people.</li>
        <li>He has a fire outfit. Crown, green cape, blue shirt.</li>
        <li class="blue">He's brave even though he is easily overpowered by others.</li>
      </ul>
